Cyber security is not just one field — it’s an ecosystem protecting every corner of our digital lives. These are the core types of Cyber security.

1.  🌐 Network Security
2.  📁 Information Security (InfoSec)
3.  🧩 Application Security (SppSec)
4.  📱  Mobile Security
5.  ☁️ Cloud Security
6.  💻 Endpoint Security
7.  ⚙️ Operational Security (OpSec)
8.  🔐 Identity & Access Management
9.  🧯  Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity
10. 🤖 Internet of Things (IoT) Security

## 1.  🌐 Network Security : 

- Network is a group of devices connected together to share information.
- Network Security is practice of protecting computer networks and data travelling through them from the unauthorised access, misuse or cyber attacks.
- This includes only proctecting from computer networks like LAN, WAN and WIFI Mobile network like 4G, 5G are not included because it will be maitained by the telecom providers like Jio, Airtel etc.

## 2.  📁 Information Security (InfoSec) : 

- Information is a data that has value like personal details, financial records etc.
- Network Security is practice of protecting information(data) from from the unauthorised access, aleration or destruction whether the data is stored, transmitted, or being processed.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Threats</strong></td>
    <td>Data leakage, Insider threat</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Tools & Techniques</strong></td>

## 3. 🧩 Application Security(AppSec) : 
- Application is a software program designed to perform certian task for the user. Web, mobile, desktop apps.
- Application Security is the practice of protecting applications by identifying, testing, and fixing security weaknesses.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Threats</strong></td>
    <td>SQLI, CSRF, XSS and many application vulnerabilities</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Tools & Techniques</strong></td>
    <td>Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), Web Application Firewalls (WAF), OWASP Top 10 guidelines, Penetration Testing</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Goal</strong></td>
    <td>Ensuring the security of software from unauthorized access, data breaches, and misuse of applications.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Analogy</strong></td>
    <td>Secure Door lock</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 4. 📱 Mobile Security :

- Mobile Security protects smartphones, tablets, and mobile apps from threats like malware, data theft, and unauthorized access.
 <table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Threats</strong></td>
    <td>Malicious apps, Data leakage, Rooting, Unauthorized permission</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Tools & Techniques</strong></td>
    <td>pp Sandboxing, Mobile Device Management (MDM), Encryption, Authentication</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Goal</strong></td>
    <td>Protect mobile devices and data from mobile-specific attacks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Analogy</strong></td>
    <td>>Personal Bodyguard</td>
  </tr>
</table>


## 5. ☁️ Cloud Security :

- Cloud refers to storing, managing, and processing data over the internet instead of using local computers or servers (examples: Google Drive, YouTube videos, Netflix movies).
- Cloud Security protects data and applications hosted in the cloud environment from breaches and misuse.
<table> <tr> <td><strong>Threats</strong></td> <td>Data breaches, Misconfigurations, Unauthorized access, Account hijacking</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Tools & Techniques</strong></td> <td>Identity & Access Management, Cloud Firewalls, Security Monitoring</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Goal</strong></td> <td>Protect cloud data and ensure secure access to cloud resources</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Analogy</strong></td> <td>Secured Cloud Vault</td> </tr> </table>


## 6. 💻 Endpoint Security :

- Endpoint is refers to any device which is connected to a network and can communicate with other devices or servers.
- Endpoint Security focuses on protecting individual devices such as laptops, desktops, and IoT devices from the unauthorized access.
<table> <tr> <td><strong>Threats</strong></td> <td>Malware, Ransomware, Unauthorized device access</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Tools & Techniques</strong></td> <td>Antivirus, EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response), Device Hardening</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Goal</strong></td> <td>Ensure every device connected to the network remains secure</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Analogy</strong></td> <td>Saftey</td> </tr> </table>

## 7. ⚙️ Operational Security (OpSec) :

- Operational refers to day-to-day operations and activities of an organization. basically how things are done in the business/IT process.
- Operational Security (OpSec) is  protecting an organization’s sensitive operations and processes from being exploited or observed by attackers.
<table> <tr> <td><strong>Threats</strong></td> <td>Human errors, Policy violations, Insider misuse</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Tools & Techniques</strong></td> <td>Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC), Access Controls, Audits</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Goal</strong></td> <td>Ensure operational processes protect organizational data</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Analogy</strong></td> <td>Company Rulebook</td> </tr> </table>


## 8.  🔐 Identity & Access Management : 

- IAM controls who can access what resources and ensures authentication, authorization, and accountability across systems.
<table> <tr> <td><strong>Threats</strong></td> <td>Unauthorized access, Credential theft, Privilege escalation</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Tools & Techniques</strong></td> <td>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Single Sign-On(SSO), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Goal</strong></td> <td>Verify user identities and enforce appropriate access levels</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Analogy</strong></td> <td>Security ID Card</td> </tr> </table>

## 9. 🧯 Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity : 

- This security practice is for preventing data loss or minimizing downtime incase of any natural disaster or emergency like system failures. 
<table> <tr> <td><strong>Threats</strong></td> <td>System failures, Ransomware attacks, Natural disasters</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Tools & Techniques</strong></td> <td>Backup Systems, Incident Response Plan, Recovery Drills</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Goal</strong></td> <td>Restore systems quickly and maintain business operations</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Analogy</strong></td> <td>Emergency Exit Plan</td> </tr> </table>

## 🤖 10. Internet of Things (IoT) Security : 

- IoT (Internet of Things) refers to physical devices connected to the internet that can collect, share, and exchange data. example : smart watches, smart home devices like camera.
- IoT Security protects smart and connected devices such as sensors, cameras, and appliances from vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.
<table> <tr> <td><strong>Threats</strong></td> <td>Device hijacking, Botnets, Data interception</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Tools & Techniques</strong></td> <td>Firmware Updates, Network Segmentation, Strong Authentication</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Goal</strong></td> <td>Protect IoT devices and the data they transmit</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Analogy</strong></td> <td>Smart Home Lock</td> </tr> </table>
